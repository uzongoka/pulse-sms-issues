# Pulse SMS Issue Tracker and Road Map

**This is not a support section**, if you need support or have a question about the app please start [here](https://messenger.klinkerapps.com/help).

This repo will be used for tracking issues and act as a roadmap across all of Pulse's platforms:

1. Android App
2. Backend Server
3. Web Client
4. Chrome App/Extension
5. Native Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)

To view the currently reported issues and requests, simply hit the [issues](https://github.com/klinker-apps/messenger-issues/issues) tab at the top of the screen.

## Filing an Issue or Request

If you have an issue with the app or a feature request, this is the place to report it to us and get feedback on it! You'll also be able to tell what work is being done on the issue and when it has been completed.

When filing an issue with us, please follow these simple rules:

1. Fill in your issue frmo the templates available.
1. Search before adding a new issue. If a duplicate is submitted it will be closed.
2. Use proper [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) syntax.
3. Create a fitting title to quickly describe the issue.
4. Take your time and explain the issue, steps to repeat it or other things that may help us to solve it. Screenshots are also encouraged.
5. Type in clear English. If we can't understand it then it will unfortunately need to be closed.

To report your issue, find the `Issues` link near the top of the web page and click it. Then in the right corner, click the green button labeled `New issue`.

## Contributing to Pulse SMS

Want to dig in to some code yourself, rather than just report issues to this page? I have three open-source Pulse clients that you can take a look at:

1. The Pulse web app, built on Vue.js: https://github.com/klinker-apps/messenger-web
2. The Pulse desktop clients, built on Electron: https://github.com/klinker-apps/messenger-desktop
3. The Pulse iOS client, built in Swift: https://github.com/klinker-apps/messenger-ios
4. The Pulse Chrome app and browser extension: https://github.com/klinker-apps/messenger-chrome
5. The Pulse Tizen app, for Galaxy Watches: https://github.com/klinker-apps/messenger-tizen

If you are interested in helping, take a look and see what you can build. I am always open to quality contributions towards the app! 

The backend and Android apps are not open-source. All the issue tracking/feature requests, for the two repos above, will still be done on this page, as well.
